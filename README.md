# Recover-E

## What it does

This extension saves all text inputs and text areas in the current web page as a single session.

If the page crashes, refreshed or visited in the future, the user can then choose a session to recover which will populate all filled fields.

To test it out, visit https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/recover-e/ and add it to your browser.
